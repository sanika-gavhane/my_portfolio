  <section class="about">
  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    Hello! I’m <strong>Sanika Dashrath Gavhane</strong>, a passionate and self-driven developer who believes in turning logic into living code. From debugging stubborn bugs to designing clean layouts, I enjoy every step of building meaningful software.
  </p>

  <p>
    My journey started with curiosity — a curiosity to know how things work behind the screen. Today, that curiosity has shaped into skills like <strong>Java</strong>, <strong>SQL</strong>, <strong>HTML/CSS</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong>, and real-time projects like a <em>Diabetes Risk Predictor</em> and a <em>Movie Recommendation System</em>.
  </p>

  <p>
    I don’t just write code — I solve problems. Whether it’s building a backend with Node.js or optimizing a database, I approach every task with logic, patience, and a cup of chai. ☕
  </p>

  <p style="font-style: italic; color: #4b6cb7;">
    “Still learning, still exploring — one line of code at a time.”
